Project 1  CS-300


One of the main goals of Project One was to optimize the memory usage and run-time performance of several data structures. Several factors, including space and time complexity, were considered in selecting the most efficient data structures. To gain insights into the performance characteristics of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and trees, we implemented and analyzed them.

Data structures and their underlying principles were crucial to solving this problem. Based on the nature of the operations involved, I selected the most appropriate data structure for each task. In order to improve the performance of software systems, it is vital to understand data structures, since they directly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of algorithms.

For certain scenarios, selecting the optimal data structure was a major roadblock during this project. By revising fundamental data structure concepts, conducting additional research, and integrating course materials, we were able to overcome these challenges. A successful way of overcoming obstacles was also to collaborate with peers and seek assistance from the instructor.
